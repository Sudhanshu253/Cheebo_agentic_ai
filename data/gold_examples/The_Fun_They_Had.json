  "topic": "The Fun They Had - Isaac Asimov",
  "summary": "\"The Fun They Had\" is a short story set in 2157 that contrasts old-fashioned paper books and human-run schools with automated, individualized mechanical schooling. Two children, Margie and Tommy find an old printed book about schools of the past and debate the differences between communal schooling with human teachers and the isolated, mechanical method they experience. The story explores themes of nostalgia, the nature of learning, and how technology shapes social life and childhood experiences. Through Margie's curiosity and Tommy's explanations, the narrative highlights both the efficiencies and the emotional losses caused by fully automated education.",
