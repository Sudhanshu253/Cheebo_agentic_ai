On the page headed May 17, 2157, she wrote, \"Today, Tommy found a real book!\"\n\nIt was a very old book. Margie's grandfather once said that when he was a little boy his grandfather told him that there was a time when all stories were printed on paper.\n\nThey turned the pages, which were yellow and crinkly, and it was awfully funny to read words that stood still instead of moving the way they were supposed to--on a screen, you know. And then, when they turned back to the page before, it had the same words on it that it had had when they read it the first time.\n\n\"Gee,\" said Tommy, \"what a waste. When you're through with the book, you just throw it away, I guess. Our television screen must have had a million books on it and it's good for plenty more. I wouldn't throw it away.\"\n\n\"Same with mine,\" said Margie. She was eleven and hadn't seen as many telebooks as Tommy had. He was thirteen. She said, \"Where did you find it?\"\n\n\"In my house.\" He pointed without looking, because he was busy reading. \"In the attic.\" \"What's it about?\n\n\"School.\"\n\nMargie was scornful. \"School? What's there to write about school? I hate school.\"\n\nMargie always hated school, but now she hated it more than ever. The mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County Inspector.\n\n----\n\nSource: The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf\n\nThe mechanical teacher had been giving her test after test in geography and she had been doing worse and worse until her mother had shaken her head sorrowfully and sent for the County Inspector.\n\nHe was a round little man with a red face and a whole box of tools with dials and wires. He smiled at Margie and gave her an apple, then took the teacher apart. Margie had hoped he wouldn't know how to put it together again, but he knew how all right, and, after an hour or so, there it was again, large and black and ugly, with a big screen on which all the lessons were shown and the questions were asked. That wasn't so bad. The part Margie hated most was the slot where she had to put homework and test papers. She always had to write them out in a punch code they made her learn when she was six years old, and the mechanical teacher calculated the mark in no time.\n\nThe Inspector had smiled after he was finished and patted Margie's head. He said to her mother, \"It's not the little girl's fault, Mrs. Jones. I think the geography sector was geared a little too quick. Those things happen sometimes. I've slowed it up to an average ten-year level. Actually, the over-all pattern of her progress is quite satisfactory.\" And he patted Margie's head again.\n\nMargie was disappointed. She had been hoping they would take the teacher away altogether. They had once taken Tommy's teacher away for nearly a month because the history sector had blanked out completely.\n\n----\n\nSource: The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf\n\nThe-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548-be08fc77b345.pdf The-Fun-They-Had_5805e54f-1d69-4ba3-a548"
